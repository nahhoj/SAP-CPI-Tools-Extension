# SAP CPI Tools Extension

## Description
This extension was developed as a hobby in my free time, but now I use it in my job, and it has been very useful to me. With 5 years of experience working with SAP CPI, Iâ€™ve always wanted to build tools that improve the user experience. This extension includes several features designed to simplify the process of building and checking iFlows in SAP CPI.

## Features
- **Logged-in User & Environment Info**: Displays information about the logged-in user and the environment in use.
- **iFlow Deployment Status**: In the Artifacts tab (Design section), it shows whether the flow is deployed or not.
- **Security Materials**: Added a button to view information (including passwords) in the Security Materials section.
- **Keystore Section**: Added a button to download the key pair in the Keystore section.
- **Trace & Attachments**: A pretty printer in the Trace and Attachments section in the Monitor Message.
- **Trace Activation**: Added a Trace button in the Design Editor for the iFlow to enable trace activation.
- **iFlow Info**: Added an Info button in the Design Editor to show important details about the iFlow.
- **Messages Button**: In the Design Editor, added a button to display the latest messages, allowing you to open the trace or view messages for each step by drawing it in the iFlow design.
- **Where used list**: Added a button in the header to search for any word in all iFlows.
- **Find in attachment**: Added a function to search attachments in an IFlow.
